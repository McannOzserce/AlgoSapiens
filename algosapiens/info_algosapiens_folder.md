This directory is the root folder of our project. Every folder within this directory has been named and placed according to its purpose.

Just like this information file, you will find .md files inside each folder explaining what that folder is used for.

The main folder is the primary directory containing the runners (executables) to initialize the entire program's content. It is not recommended to launch content from directories other than this one.

`requirements.txt` includes package that we need, you can run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in terminal.
