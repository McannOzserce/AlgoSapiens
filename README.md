# AlgoSapiens: Building a Predictive Intelligence from Scratch

## 1. Mission & Philosophy: Education Over Profit

> **PROJECT DISCLAIMER: This is NOT a trading bot. Its goal is NOT financial gain.**

`AlgoSapiens` is a purely **educational** endeavor. It is a personal challengeâ€”an exercise in computer science, statistics, and applied logic.

The mission is to build a predictive "intelligence" (a *Sapiens*) from its foundational algorithms (*Algo*). Instead of importing pre-built models like `TensorFlow` or `XGBoost` and treating them as magical "black boxes," this repository documents the personal development journey of building a decision-making engine from its most fundamental components.

The goal is not to create a tool that *makes money*, but to answer the question:
**"Can I write a program that *learns* to find meaningful patterns in chaos, and what does that process teach me about the nature of 'learning' itself?"**

## 2. The Technical Problem: A "Learning" Framework

To achieve this educational goal, we define a clear technical problem for our `AlgoSapiens` to solve. It's a **binary classification problem**:

> "Given a set of historical data (features), what is the probability that a specific pattern (our 'target') will occur?"

* **Target = 1 (True):** Yes, the defined pattern was successfully identified.
* **Target = 0 (False):** No, the pattern was not identified (it was noise).

The model's purpose is to learn the complex, non-obvious relationships between the "past" (features) and this "future" (target).

## 3. The Approach: A Phased Methodology

This project is built in logical phases, each documenting a step in self-development.

### Phase 1: The Foundation (Data & Feature Engineering)

Before "thinking" can happen, we must provide "senses." This phase is about preparing the data.
1.  **Data Collection:** Acquiring historical data (e.g., OHLCV from a financial market, but it could be any dataset).
2.  **Data Preparation:** Cleaning and structuring the data using `pandas`.
3.  **Labeling:** Creating the "Target" (1 or 0) for every single time step, as defined in "The Problem".
4.  **Feature Engineering:** Manually creating the "clues" (features) that the model will use. This is where we hypothesize what *might* be important (e.g., lags, rolling averages, statistical properties).

### Phase 2: The Core Algorithm (The "Brain" from Scratch)

This is the heart of the project. We will implement a **Decision Tree** algorithm using only Python and NumPy/Pandas. This involves coding:
1.  **The "Split" Logic:** A function that iterates through all features and all possible threshold values (e.g., "is `feature_A` < 30?") to find the *single best question* that splits the data.
2.  **Purity Metric:** Implementing a scoring system (like **Gini Impurity** or **Information Gain/Entropy**) to mathematically decide which "question" is best.
3.  **The "Grow" Logic:** A **recursive** function that applies the split logic over and over, building a "tree" of questions until it reaches a conclusion (a "leaf" node).

### Phase 3: Evaluation & Refinement (Measuring "Learning")

A model is only as good as our ability to understand its "thoughts." The goal is *not* to measure profit.
1.  **Backtesting:** A framework to simulate the model's performance on historical data it has *never seen before* (the test set).
2.  **Metrics:** Measuring success by its predictive power: **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score**. The goal is to see if it *actually learned* the pattern.
3.  **Tuning:** Controlling the model's complexity (e.g., `max_depth` of the tree) to prevent **overfitting** (simply "memorizing" the past instead of "learning" from it).

### Phase 4: The Vision (Expanding the Mind)

Once a single "neuron" (Decision Tree) is understood, the foundation is laid for a more complex "brain" (Ensemble models):
* **Random Forest:** Building *many* trees from scratch and letting them "vote."
* **Gradient Boosting:** Building a tree, then building a *second* tree that tries to predict the *errors* of the first tree, and so on.

## 4. Tech Stack

* **Python 3.x**
* **Pandas:** For all data manipulation and feature engineering.
* **NumPy:** For high-performance numerical operations.
* **(Optional) Plotly / Matplotlib:** For visualizing data and results.
